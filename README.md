# Predicting Titanic survivors
This code uses the scikit-learn python library to implement a simple Random
Forest algorithm for predicting the survival of a Titanic passenger based on
available data. The data acquisition and preprocessing is achieved using the
pandas python library. This is for the Kaggle Tutorial competition at
[www.kaggle.com/c/titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).
